# EckeSchnecke

EckeSchnecke visualizes a person’s housing history by connecting past addresses into a continuous path within Berlin’s city limits. The result is a privacy-preserving, pixelated map shape that can be exported as an SVG for use as a profile image or digital badge.

## Features

- **Address Timeline Input**: Enter your Berlin address history.
- **Privacy-First**: Addresses are converted to coarse points; no precise geography is stored or displayed.
- **Generative Badge**: Creates a unique SVG path based on your history.
- **Berlin-Centric**: Optimized for Berlin addresses and districts.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
